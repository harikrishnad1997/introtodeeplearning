        "In addition to defining models using the `Sequential` API, we can also define neural networks by directly subclassing the [`Model`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model?version=stable) class, which groups layers together to enable model training and inference. The `Model` class captures what we refer to as a \"model\" or as a \"network\". Using Subclassing, we can create a class for our model, and then define the forward pass through the network using the `call` function. Subclassing affords the flexibility to define custom layers, custom training loops, custom activation functions, and custom models. Let's define the same neural network as above now using Subclassing rather than the `Sequential` model."
